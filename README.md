# Tools and technologies

For fast and safe development, I used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) as a base for this project. [CRA](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) is the best way to start building a new simple application in React. It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript/TypeScript features, provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production. 

When youâ€™re ready to deploy to production, running npm run build will create an optimized build of your app in the build folder. You can learn more about Create React App from its [README](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app#create-react-app--) and the [User Guide](https://create-react-app.dev/).

To fetch data I used [ApolloClient](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/get-started/)


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
